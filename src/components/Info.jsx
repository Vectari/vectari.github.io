      <StyledInfo>
        I have been learning programming since 2022 to become a Frontend
        Developer. React is my primary technology, but I am eager to seize every
        opportunity to broaden my horizons. Notable achievements include
        creating a website for a real company - Matchmaking Office
        &ldquo;Serduszka Dwa&ldquo;. Additionally, I participated in intive
        Patronage 2023, where as a member of the frontend and backend
        development team, I created a budget management application.

        Apart from programming, I love spending time in the forest, preferably
        in a hammock with a good non-fiction book, although I also respect
        novels about elves. I play the drums and guitar, and I enjoy listening
        to loud music. Black humor amuses me, and since my the first
        &ldquo;Hello world&ldquo;, I&apos;ve been drinking too much coffee.
